Calculate Grade

Write a program that will print the "letter" equivalent 
of the grade, for example:
when grade = 90 to 100 # -> expect A
when grade = 80 to 89 # -> expect B
when grade = 70 to 79 # -> expect C
when grade = 60 to 69 # -> expect D
when grade = 0 to 59 # -> expect F
when grade = -10 # -> expect Error
when grade = 10000 # -> expect Error
when grade = "lol skool sucks" # -> expect Error

grade = None
