"""
Sum Factors

Write a function called "sum_factors" that takes two numbers 
and returns the sum of their factors, while the sum is
between 0 and some limit/upper bound. These items should be 
generalized as parameters. Do NOT double-count numbers that 
are factors of BOTH the original two numbers entered. If any 
inputs aren't integers, print a string with some error message.
